# Guitar Fretboard Learning Tool - Product Feature Document

## Product Overview

The Guitar Fretboard Learning Tool is a static web application designed to help guitar students and educators visualize, practice, and understand the guitar fretboard through interactive note placement and interval recognition. The application provides a printable, drag-and-drop interface for creating custom fretboard diagrams with advanced music theory visualization capabilities.

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Guitar students learning fretboard navigation and music theory
- **Secondary**: Guitar instructors creating teaching materials and exercises
- **Tertiary**: Musicians exploring chord progressions and scale patterns

## Core Value Proposition

Enables users to create, manipulate, and save custom guitar fretboard diagrams with automatic interval calculation and music theory visualization, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical fretboard application.

## Key Features

### 1. Canvas-Based Design Environment
- **Print-ready workspace**: Standard paper dimensions (8.5" x 11") for physical practice
- **Orientation flexibility**: Toggle between portrait and landscape modes
- **Edit state management**: Lock/unlock canvas to prevent accidental modifications
- **File persistence**: Save/load workspace state via JSON export/import

### 2. Interactive Fretboard Grid System
- **Dynamic grid creation**: One-click fretboard generation with configurable parameters
- **Flexible fret range**: Customizable start (0-24) and end positions (0-24)
- **Variable string configuration**: Support for 4-12 string instruments with custom tunings
- **Visual fret markers**: Industry-standard dot patterns at frets 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 17, 19, 21

### 3. Advanced Note Placement & Visualization
- **Chromatic note system**: Full 12-tone chromatic scale with distinct color coding
- **Smart note display**: Natural notes (A-G) show letter names; accidentals remain unlabeled
- **Color grouping system**: Four-level visual grouping for pattern recognition
- **Root note designation**: Double-click functionality for establishing tonal centers

### 4. Automatic Music Theory Analysis
- **Real-time interval calculation**: Automatic interval highlighting relative to selected root
- **Color-coded intervals**: Distinct colors for 3rds, 5ths, 7ths, and octaves
- **Colorblind accessibility**: High-contrast, accessible color palette throughout
- **Pattern recognition support**: Visual tools for identifying scales, chords, and progressions

### 5. Workflow Management
- **Unlimited undo/redo**: Full session history with visual feedback
- **Drag-and-drop positioning**: Intuitive grid placement and arrangement
- **Canvas boundary enforcement**: Prevents content overflow for consistent printing
- **Session persistence**: Maintain work state across browser sessions

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend-only design**: No backend dependencies for maximum portability
- **GitHub Pages deployment**: Zero-cost hosting with automatic CI/CD
- **Modern web standards**: HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Support for all modern browsers
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Optimized for tablet and desktop use

## Success Metrics

- **User engagement**: Time spent creating and manipulating fretboard diagrams
- **Content creation**: Number of grids created and notes placed per session
- **Feature adoption**: Usage rates of advanced features (intervals, grouping, root selection)
- **Educational effectiveness**: User feedback on learning outcomes and teaching utility

## Future Considerations

- **Scale template library**: Pre-built common scales and chord progressions
- **Export formats**: PDF and image export capabilities
- **Collaboration features**: Sharing and embedding functionality
- **Audio integration**: Note playback and ear training components
